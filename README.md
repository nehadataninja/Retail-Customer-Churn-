# E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

# Overview

The rapid expansion of online shopping has led to a surge in customer data, including demographics, purchase behavior, and transaction history. Understanding customer churn is crucial for businesses to implement effective retention strategies and maintain profitability. This project leverages machine learning to predict customer churn in the e-commerce industry, helping businesses reduce revenue loss and improve customer loyalty.

# Dataset

This project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle:E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

# How to Run the Code
Download all the Python notebook files (Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3).
Open Jupyter Notebook or any preferred IDE that supports .ipynb files.
Launch a command terminal.
Run each notebook sequentially by typing the filename. For example:
  1. jupyter notebook "Step 1 EDA.ipynb"
  2. Repeat the process for Step 2 and Step 3 to complete the analysis.
# Dependencies
1. Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebooks:
2. pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
# Project Structure
  Step 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.
  Step 2 - Feature Engineering & Preprocessing: Data cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.
  Step 3 - Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing machine learning models to predict customer churn and evaluate performance.
